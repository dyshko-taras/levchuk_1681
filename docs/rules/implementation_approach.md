# Implementation approach

If you create some temporary markdown files to keep notes about a feature implementation or testing, delete these files after the feature is implemented.

Start a feature implementation when you have 95% confidence in what you are going to do. Until then ask me questions if you need me to clarify anything.

After you implemented a feature, re-scan PRD and other documents that have details about this feature. Check that the code follows instructions and implements all the nuances given in the docs.

If necessary, build the debug app version to check for build erorrs.

Make sure to use real SDK, API keys, endpoints etc. that are available in the code. Don't substitute them with fake ones.

Don't run the app, I'll do it manually.
